:op:5:narration1-5:As we said earlier the results of this scientific revolution were amazing , but every now and then something rather unexpected might happen...
:op:4_6:narration1-6:This brings us to our story , in which a new experiment was put in place...
:op:7_8:narration1-7:This peculiar experiment would see that there's a possibilty to genetically modify a plant to make it survive in aquatic territory , and to make things interesting... 
:op:7_8:narration1-8:...They chose a cactus as a test subject ,the most hydrophobic plant in existence. 
:op:9.1:narration1-9:The experiment turned out to be a success,and while everyone was enjoying pizza as celebration.
