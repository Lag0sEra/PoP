:X:defeat:Xfinal1: Good lord... you... commonfolk... cough
:jimmy:confident:xorcismJ1: Blue kid! Thank you so much! That was probably the most awesome thing I've ever done.
:bf:yeah:BF: beep skboop!
:X:defeat:Xfinal2: J.1.2.M.Y... Jimmy, if you'd prefer. I suppose you weren't Xterminated after all. It shows your resilience. 
:jimmy:nervous:xorcismJ2: Is... that a compliment?
:X:defeat:Xfinal3: I suppose. But Progress Inc. wants you dead regardless. While I may follow their orders, you and your little friend seem happy together... I may sound heartless, but I assure you that I have a lot of them. 
:jimmy:nervous:xorcismJ3: So what does this mean? We're friends?
:X:defeat:Xfinal4: No. Jimmy. I am warning you. When Progress Inc. checks in and finds me defeated, they will activate the emergency infusion mode. It will jumpstart my cyborg core, and revert me to my primal state.
:jimmy:determined:xorcismJ4: Primal state?
:X:defeat:Xfinal5: You do not want to be around when X-Odia arrives. My other side is all the power of my synthetic body, combined with the murderous intent of a Vampire Squid.
:gf:what:GF: I thought you were an octopus?
:X:defeat:Xfinal6: Young miss, take the cactus as far as you can, and the boy too. Run. 
:bf:neutral:BF: I'm not leaving behind someone who's suffering , we're fighting this curse and bring you back to normal! 
:gf:nervous:GF: No, BF. You can't stay here.
:bf:angry:BF: Just.....GO! Imma fight this thing as long as I can so you can flee back to safety. Trust me on this baby...
:gf:nervous:GF: True... it will buy us some time. 
:X:defeat:Xfinal7: I already feel the toxins coursing. You need to leave.
:jimmy:glad:xorcismJ5: Blue boy! Good luck. Please be safe.
:bf:yeah:BF: Don't worry vegetable I'll be just fine!
:gf:hopeful:GF: Be careful Boyfriend.
:none:none:none: They run across the boardwalk off the beach, leaving BF staring at Project X, who begins to shake and convulse.
:X:defeat:Xfinal8: I suppose it is just... u-us now. I may have not been the kindest in our p-previous bout, but I am sorry now. S-s-sing for your life. X-Odia will show you no mercy.
:bf:angry:BF: Bop Bep...
:fade
:X:demon:Xfinal9: I... will show you no mercy. Human... thing.
