:jimmy:Nervous:photoJ1:whew.... that was a wild ride... could we talk it out instead of fighting? I think you misunderstood what I said...
:gf:angy:gf:Explain yourself then! You can't just go around calling people large!
:jimmy:Sad:photoJ2:I just meant to compliment you because you just look nice...but i didn't know what to say... I-t wasn't my intention to offend you! I'm sorry... 
:gf:happy:gf:You shouldn't have said I looked large! But you apologized, so we're cool now.
:bf:neutral:bf:Since you didn't insult my gf, how about we rap for fun this time? pretty sure you said you knew how, and I could use the practice. I have some unfinished buisness back home...
